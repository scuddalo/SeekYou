		<b>&quot;You've probably had it happen...&quot;</b><br/>
		<br/>
		
		You and one of your most important clients are at the same conference, but you lose an opportunity to develop the relationship because you don't know that he's there. You miss the connection.<br/><br/>
		
		Or you and a colleague are in the same city but don't know it. You could get together and work on that proposal due in two days. But you miss the connection.<br/><br/>
		
		Or you find yourself in a city where you don't know anyone. Except the two classmates from graduate school who live here now, but you don't know that. You miss the connection.<br/><br/>
		
		In a mobile world, making and maintaining personal connections is harder -- and more important -- than ever. SeekYou just made it easier, and better. Watch:<br/><br/>

	Making connections. Up to this point, professionals have relied on...luck. Or maybe one or two technology services that alert you to when a contact is traveling somewhere, with you usually finding out after the fact.<br/><br/>
SeekYou was created by professionals, for professionals, to solve that problem and give you more opportunity: the opportunity to connect, face-to-face, right now, with colleagues, clients, customers, classmates, old friends, new possibilities.<br/><br/>
SeekYou. The permission-based mobile connection application that enables you to connect with any of your contacts, everywhere.<br/><br/>
Because some connections are too important to miss.<br/><br/>

	<div id="heading_3" style="padding:0px 0 0px 0px;"><h2>What makes SeekYou different</h2></div>
	<br/><br/>
	<div class="text" style="padding:5px 0 0 10px;">
		Here's what SeekYou isn't: Loopt, Gowalla, Rally Up, AroundMe, Dopplr, Foursquare, Brightkite, Latitude, Poynt, Scvngr, Facebook Places, WeePlaces, or any of the other casual Location-Based Services
		
applications. SeekYou is a mobile enterprise application designed by professionals, for professionals.<br/>
<br/>

SeekYou works with your affiliations -- your alumni associations, your professional associations, your company or organization's employee list, your client list -- to provide you with a meaningful database of people who are near your location. It gives you the opportunity to see and connect with the people around you who are important to you. It gives you the opportunity to maintain your critical professional relationships. It gives you the opportunities that you would otherwise miss.<br/><br/>

In fact, the event that started SeekYou took place at London Heathrow when two colleagues just missed the chance to connect with each other, because neither knew that the other was there.<br/><br/>

SeekYou has no check-ins, no badges, no mayors, no broadcasts to the world: just an efficient, private, permission-based way to maintain your professional connections.<br/><br/>

	<div id="heading_3" style="padding:0px 0 0px 0px;"><h2>An Opportunity for Private Investment.</h2></div>
	
	<div class="text" style="padding:5px 0 0 10px;">
	SeekYou was created and is being developed by graduate-school professors and former graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University and is, as they say in startup-speak, in stealth mode. This is a private website for investors so, if you're here, this address was likely given to you by someone who thought that you might have an interest in private investment, and want to know more.<br/><br/>
	
SeekYou is not seeking venture financing at this time, so the opportunity for early investors is more attractive.<br/><br/>
