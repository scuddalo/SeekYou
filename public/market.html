		TechCrunch put it nicely when they said that mobile location-based services had experienced a number of "false dawns" between 2000 and 2007. So why believe that things are real this time? While the data isn't in perfect alignment (it seldom is), it points in the right direction (the "this is a viable market" direction).<br/><br/>
		
According to a 2010 Forrester Research study, only 4% of US online (note: not mobile) adults have ever used an online location-based social network (LBSN) application such as Foursquare, Gowalla or Loopt, and only 1% of those who have used one of those applications use it once a week. 84% of those surveyed were unaware of such applications. (1)<br/><br/>

Things look a little brighter in a 2010 Pew Research survey (n=3,001 US adults) which found that 7% of adult mobile phone users check in with a location-based service. (2)<br/><br/>

Microsoft's 2010 research (n=1,500 worldwide adults) found that 51% of the survey used all forms of location-based applications (not just check-in services, but navigation, weather alerts, traffic updates, etc) with 50% of the users in the US, and 94% of the sample considering those services to be valuable. (3)<br/><br/>

Research firm Gartner Group weighed in on human impact, predicting that the LBS user base will grow from 96 million in 2009 to 526 million in 2012. (4)<br/><br/>

And a Juniper Research study released in January 2010 projected a US$12.7B worldwide market for location-based services by 2014 (5).<br/><br/>
 A similar 2010 study from research firm Global Industry Analysts puts the number at US$21.14B worldwide by 2015. (6)<br/><br/>
 
An increase in smartphone penetration will be one more thing that will obviously drive the market; we like the facts that 1) a 2010 compete.com study showed that 35% of current cell phone users plan to upgrade to a smartphone (7); 2) the iPhone is now available on Verizon's network (and as everyone now knows, broke all sales records) (8); and 3) SeekYou's marketplace is populated by professionals: the folks mostly like to have -- and constantly use -- smartphones.<br/><br/>

We think that there's a market. The market thinks that there's a market. And there are already many companies, developers and applications in and around the market, but none that have targeted the "professional" part of the market as SeekYou has. Obviously, as the market further develops, there will be. Our goal is to get there first, and with the best product.<br/><br/>

In fact, the biggest concern about the location-based services market is, not surprisingly, privacy. According to the above-referenced December 2010 Microsoft study (n=300 in each of five countries), 94% of respondents said that they thought that location-based services were valuable, but 52% were concerned about the potential loss of privacy, and 84% were concerned about sharing their location without consent (9).<br/><br/>

Fortunately, this is an area that SeekYou has made a rabid focus. SeekYou allows users to set "tiers" of contact permissions, and only publishes user location to the specific contacts that have been enabled. There is no opportunity for third-party applications to scrape data (as is possible, for example, from a Foursquare check-in) and make a user's location known. <br/><br/>
